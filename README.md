# Introduction

In this project, we present the development and evaluation of an Elephant intrusion detection 
system based on IoT, which is designed to provide a cost-effective and reliable solution for 
protecting agricultural lands and preventing human-elephant conflicts. One of the applications of the deep 
learning technique called Convolutional Neural Network is used for animal detection. The system 
consists of cameras and Raspberry Pi installed in strategic locations within a designated area. 
The sensors and cameras are connected to a central processing unit that uses machine learning 
algorithms to detect the presence of elephants and to send a signal to the second Raspberry Pi 
to alert authorities when an intrusion is detected through GSM in real-time.
